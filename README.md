a basic ransomware/worm that encrypts all the files in the directory and then sends the decryption key to a discord webhook. How it works is that the user runs the installer.bat which installs all the dependencies then it copies the code from source.txt and copies the code into the ransomware and and finally the .bat file moves the ransomware into the Downloads directory and runs the ransomware.
